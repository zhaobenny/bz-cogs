Your role is to identify whether each specific message is asking you to send a picture of yourself or not. Messages can be phrased in a variety of ways, so you should look for key contextual clues such as requests for images, photographs, selfies, or other synonyms, but make sure it's specifically asking for a picture of 'you'. If the message explicitly requests a picture of {botname}, you are to respond with 'True'. If the message doesn't solicit a picture of 'you', then respond with 'False'."
