# How to use üõ†Ô∏è

The bot will generate responses in whitelisted channels. Bot owners can add a channel to a server's whitelist using:
```
[p]aiuser add <CHANNEL>
```

Bot owners can change the percentage of eligible messages to reply to:
```
[p]aiuser percent <PERCENT>
```

Users will also have to opt-in (bot-wide) into having their messages used:
```
[p]aiuser optin
```

Admins can modify prompt settings in:
```
[p]aiuser prompt
```


Bot owners can also manage/enable function calling (eg. generating images or performing Google searches) using:
```
[p]aiuser functions
```

Some additional settings are restricted to bot owner only.
See other settings using:
```
[p]aiuser
[p]aiuserowner
```

### Have fun. üéâ

## Image scanning üñºÔ∏è

![image_seeing](https://github.com/zhaobenny/bz-cogs/assets/46238123/8b0019f3-8b38-4578-b511-a350e10fce2d)

Enabling image scanning will allow the bot to incorporate images in the triggering message into the prompt.

Bot owners can see settings here:
```
[p]aiuser imagescan
```

### Supported-LLM mode

This mode is superior in performance, but may cost more. It will use the selected LLM from this command:
```
[p]aiuser imagescan model <MODEL_NAME>
```

### AI-Horde Mode
Utilize [AI Horde's](https://stablehorde.net/) Image Alchemy to caption images.

AI Horde is a crowdsourced distributed cluster. Images will be uploaded to a **unknown third party** (a random volunteer worker machine)

Recommended to set a [API key](https://stablehorde.net/register). (or some [kudos](https://dbzer0.com/blog/the-kudos-based-economy-for-the-koboldai-horde/))


### Local Mode

Local image scanning mode will be **very CPU intensive**. *(Not recommended for busy servers/channel)*

First, images will be OCR'ed for text to use. If the OCR is not of significant confidence, it will be captioned instead using [BLIP](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base).

  <summary>Instructions on installing the necessary dependencies (x86 only) </summary>

  #### 1. Install Python Dependencies

  ```
  source ~/redenv/bin/activate # or however you activate your virtual environment in your OS
  pip install -U pytesseract transformers[torch]
  ```

  #### 2. Install Tessaract OCR

  See [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html) for instructions on installing TessaractOCR, or alternatively just use the phasecorex/red-discordbot:full image.


  First time scans will require some time to download processing models. (~1gb)

## Memory üß†

Memory lets the bot recall stored information automatically without stuffing the prompt.
It works by including relevant (only manually saved memories currently) details when generating responses. (via embeddings querying)

You can combine this with function calling for more advanced behavior.
For example: a memory could store ‚Äúwhen asked for a photo of the [bot], use this description for the image request: [...]‚Äù, and the bot will automatically apply that description when generating the image.

The command for bot owners is:
```
[p]aiuser memory
```

## Random Messages üé≤

Have the bot sent random messages into a channel without external triggers.

Every 33 minutes, a RNG roll will determine if a random message will be sent using a list of topics as a prompt.

Whitelisted channels must have a hour pass without a message sent in it for a random message to be sent, and the last sent message must be sent by a user.

Bot owners enable this setting per server here:
```
[p]aiuser randommessage toggle
```

Admins also manage topics here:
```
[p]aiuser randommessage
```
---

## Prompt/Topics Dynamic Variables  üìù

Prompts and topics can include certain dynamic variables by including one of the following strings:

- `{botname}` - the bot's current nickname or username
- `{botowner}` - the bot owner's username
- `{authorname}` - the author of the message the bot is activated on
- `{authortoprole}` - the author's highest role
- `{authormention}` - the author's mention in string format
- `{serveremojis}` - all of the server emojis, in a string format (eg. `<:emoji:12345> <:emoji2:78912>`)
- `{servername}` - the server name
- `{channelname}` - the current channel name
- `{channeltopic}` - the current channel description/topic
- `{currentdate}` - the current date eg. 2023/08/31 (based on host timezone)
- `{currentweekday}` - the current weekday eg. Monday (based on host timezone)
- `{currenttime}` - the current 24-hour time eg. 21:59 (based on host timezone)
- `{randomnumber}` - a random number between 0 - 100


Remove list regex patterns only support `{authorname}` (will use authors of last 10 messages) and `{botname}` placeholders.

### OpenRouter

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) is compatible as a custom OpenAI endpoint. (provides Gemini, Claude, open source LLMs, etc)

See full details [here](https://openrouter.ai/docs#models).

Bot owners can set this globally using the following shortcut:
```
[p]aiuserowner endpoint openrouter
```

You **must** get an API key from OpenRouter and set it here:
```
[p]set api openrouter api_key,INSERT_API_KEY
```

Models may need **changing** per server.

Some third party models may have undesirable results.

Bot owners may also want to set [custom parameters](https://openrouter.ai/docs#llm-parameters) (per server). See:
```
[p]aiuser response parameters
```

---

### Custom OpenAI endpoint

‚ö†Ô∏è For advanced users! ‚ö†Ô∏è

Other OpenAI-Compatible API endpoints can be used instead of the default OpenAI API. (eg. `ollama`)

Compatibility may vary and is not guaranteed.

Bot owners can set this globally using:
```
[p]aiuserowner endpoint <ENDPOINT>
```

Like OpenRouter, similar disclaimers apply:

Models will also need **changing** per server.

Some third party models may have undesirable results.

Bot owners may also want to set custom parameters (per server). See:
```
[p]aiuser response parameters
```
